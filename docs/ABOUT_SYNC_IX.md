### What is Neuropacket?
A single, portable, signed envelope of human‑state data (metrics + computed state) that carries **consent** and **retention** with it.

### What is NPP (Neuropacket Protocol)?
A practical, implementation‑ready set of rules (schema, units, time, privacy, integrity) so devices and apps can interoperate safely.

### Principles
1) Privacy‑first (consent/scopes/retention live in the packet)  
2) Security by default (tamper‑evident hash + signature fields)  
3) Interoperability (fixed units & versioning)  
4) Non‑diagnostic (for adaptation/analytics, not medical diagnosis)
